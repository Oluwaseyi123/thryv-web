Cycle-based training is a powerful approach to fitness that aligns your workouts with your **hormonal cycle**. Instead of pushing the same intensity all month long, you work _with_ your hormones—not against them—to feel stronger, more balanced, and more consistent.

If you’ve ever wondered why some days you feel unstoppable and others you feel drained, this guide will help you understand why—and what to do about it.

---

## What Is Cycle-Based Training?

Cycle-based training means adjusting your movement and workout intensity based on the hormonal shifts that happen across your menstrual cycle.

Your hormones influence:

- energy
- strength
- recovery
- motivation
- mood
- metabolism

So it only makes sense that your training should shift with them.

---

## The Four Phases of Your Cycle (and How to Train in Each One)

### **1. Menstrual Phase (Days 1–5): Rest + Gentle Movement**

Hormones: **Low estrogen & progesterone**

You may feel:

- low energy
- cramping
- heavier limbs
- need for rest

**Best movement:**

- walking
- stretching
- restorative yoga
- mobility
- extra rest

This phase is all about listening to your body. Reduce intensity and prioritise recovery.

---

### **2. Follicular Phase (Days 6–14): Build + Explore**

Hormones: **Rising estrogen**

You may feel:

- more energised
- more motivated
- sharper thinking
- boost in confidence

**Best workouts:**

- strength training
- HIIT
- new skills
- conditioning
- running or cycling

This is your **bulletproof phase**—take advantage of the rising estrogen and push harder.

---

### **3. Ovulatory Phase (Days 15–17): Peak Performance**

Hormones: **Peak estrogen + testosterone**

You may notice:

- strong physical power
- elevated mood
- improved social energy
- increased libido

**Best workouts:**

- heavy strength sessions
- explosive training
- high-intensity workouts
- group classes
- PR attempts

This is your **power window**—enjoy it.

---

### **4. Luteal Phase (Days 18–28): Slow + Support**

Hormones: **Higher progesterone → then drop before period**

Early luteal may feel stable, but as progesterone rises, you may experience:

- bloating
- fatigue
- cravings
- irritability
- lower motivation

**Best workouts:**

- moderate strength
- low-impact cardio
- pilates
- steady-state training
- long walks

As PMS approaches, taper intensity and focus on consistency, not pushing limits.

---

## Why Cycle-Syncing Works

Cycle-syncing optimises your training by honouring your body’s **natural hormone patterns**. Benefits include:

- better energy management
- fewer burnout cycles
- more sustainable results
- improved recovery
- reduced PMS symptoms
- better performance when it counts

You’re not meant to feel the same every day—and your training shouldn’t either.

---

## How to Start Cycle-Based Training (Beginner Steps)

### **1. Track Your Cycle**

Use Thryve, your calendar, or any tracking app.  
Pay attention to:

- energy
- mood
- strength
- cravings
- motivation

Patterns will emerge quickly.

---

### **2. Match Your Weekly Training to Your Phase**

A simple beginner plan:

- **Menstrual:** rest, stretch, walk
- **Follicular:** strength + HIIT
- **Ovulatory:** heavy lifting, sprints, PRs
- **Luteal:** pilates, low-impact cardio, moderate strength

---

### **3. Adjust Intensity—Not Identity**

You can still “be a gym girl.”  
You’re just being a _smarter_ gym girl.

---

### **4. Give Yourself Permission to Flow**

You’re not lazy for needing rest during your menstrual or late luteal phase.  
You’re **hormonal, human, and intelligent.**

## When To Seek Medical Advice

Cycle syncing is safe, but consider consulting a doctor if you experience:

- extreme fatigue
- debilitating cramps
- very irregular cycles
- cycles < 21 days or > 35 days
- sudden cycle changes

Your cycle is a vital sign—your body may be telling you something.

---

## The Bottom Line

Cycle-based training allows you to train in harmony with your hormones, not in spite of them.  
You’ll move with more intention, feel more connected to your body, and see more sustainable progress.

This isn’t about doing less.  
It’s about doing what works **with your biology**.
